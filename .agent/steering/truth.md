# Seed of Truth

## Core Professional Identity
**Role:** AI Systems Engineer  
**Specializations:** 
- Agentic Workflows (LangGraph)
- Advanced RAG (Late Chunking, RRF)
- High-Performance AI Full-Stack Pipelines

## Background
- **Core Stack:** Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, C++, Java, Bash
- **AI & Data:** LangChain, Hugging Face (Transformers), LangGraph, OpenAI API, Gemini, ChromaDB, RAG, pdfplumber
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Django, Gunicorn, Nginx, Flask, Redis, Docker, AWS, GCP, REST APIs
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Playwright (E2E), Shadcn/UI
- **Key Experience:** 
  - Engineered FastAPI streaming protocols to multiplex reasoning/answer data in real-time.
  - Constructed custom PDF viewers with fuzzy-matched deep linking for AI-generated citations.
  - Deployed GPT-4o "Judge Agents" for autonomous self-correction routing to UI.
  - Implemented late-chunking and hierarchical retrieval pipelines (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) using Custom ChromaDB embedding functions.
  - Designed multi-agent LangGraph generation pipelines utilizing Map-Reduce patterns.

## Site Principles & "Truth"
1. **Technical Precision:** Every UI element must demonstrate technical exactness. Form follows function.
2. **Transparency of AI Processes:** AI integrations must be explicit and visible (e.g., exposing agent reasoning steps, streaming states, deep-linked citations, and data flows).
3. **Builder Aesthetic:** The design language must evoke the atmosphere of cutting-edge AI research labs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). The UI should be clean, minimalist, highly functional, and signal advanced engineering.

> **Directive:** This context steers all future AI code generation, UI/UX decisions, and agent reasoning within the Portfolio project, using the Antigravity framework.
